# Logo Maker

This is an app designed to create a simple logo using prompts in the node command line.  The user may enter text up to 3 characters and choose a text color. The user will also choose the shape of the logo, either triangle, circle, or square. The color of the shape is also chosen.  The completed logo is rendered into an .svg file and is visible in a browser window.

Future improvement of this designs would include sizing options, more shapes to choose from, and more stylistic features with graphics and 3D effects.
